General Rules:
1. Decks: 1 deck (up to 8)
2. Blackjack pays: 3 : 2
3. Hole card: Dealer peeks for blackjack (US)
4. Insurance: allowed if Dealer has an Ace face up
5. Insurance pays: 2 : 1
6. Soft 17: dealer hits
7. Double Down: any two cards
8. Splits any pair of cards: a maximum of 3 times to make 4 hands
9. Double after split: not allowed
10. Surrender: not allowed

How it goes:
1. We use one deck
2. A player is offered to start a new round
3. They place a bet
4. Player (P) and Dealer (D) receive 2 cards from a shuffled deck. Dealer has one of the cards face down.
5. If the dealer has an Ace exposed, then he checks for a blackjack
Player can take 'insurance', a side bet that pays 2-1
6. In case he gets a blackjack, a player loses (unless they have a blackjack as well)

If the dealer doesn't have blackjack, the game continues. Then following options are available:

1. Stand. If they think their hand is strong enough. Take no action.
2. Hit. Player is asked if they'd like another card. They're allowed to stop 'hitting' at any point
3. Double down (if allowed). Player can double their current bet and receive 1 more card. They can't double down after first 2 cards
Plus after choosing the option, they get no more than 1 card
4. Split. Separate them into 2 hands. Each card is the first card of a new hand.
Available for cards which are equally valued. Hand can be split up to 3 times ( 4 hands tops )
When the cards are split, player places a second stake on each hand, equal to the starting bet.

When the player's done, the dealer keeps hitting until his cards reach a total value of 17 or more

Scoring:
1. Player wins if their hand has a greater total point value than the dealer's, without going over 21.
2. A winning blackjack pays 3:2
3. If both the player and the dealer have a tie — including with a blackjack — the bet is a tie or "push" and money is neither lost, nor paid.
4. All other winning hands pay even money, 1:1.
5. If either the player or the dealer exceed 21 or "bust" the hand automatically loses.
6. If both the dealer and player bust, the player loses.
7. Insurance pays 2:1

Notes:
If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd card it is considered a "blackjack" and the player is paid out immediately.
The hand ties if dealer also has a natural.
