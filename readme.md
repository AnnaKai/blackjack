<h2>General Rules:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Decks: 1 deck (up to 8)</li>
  <li>Blackjack pays: 3 : 2</li>
  <li>Hole card: Dealer peeks for blackjack (US)</li>

<h2>How it goes:</h2>
<ol>
<li>We use one deck</li>
<li>A player is offered to start a new round</li>
<li>They place a bet</li>
<li>Player (P) and Dealer (D) receive 2 cards from a shuffled deck. Dealer has one of the cards face down.</li>
<li>If the dealer has an Ace exposed, then he checks for a blackjack. Player can take 'insurance', a side bet that pays 2-1.
In case he gets a blackjack, a player loses (unless they have a blackjack as well)</li>
</ol>

<p>If the dealer doesn't have blackjack, the game continues. Then following options are available:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stand. If they think their hand is strong enough. Take no action.</li>
<li>Hit. Player is asked if they'd like another card. They're allowed to stop 'hitting' at any point</li>
<li>Double down (if allowed). Player can double their current bet and receive 1 more card. They can't double down after first 2 cards
Plus after choosing the option, they get no more than 1 card</li>
<li>Split. Separate them into 2 hands. Each card is the first card of a new hand.
Available for cards which are equally valued. Hand can be split up to 3 times ( 4 hands tops )
When the cards are split, player places a second stake on each hand, equal to the starting bet.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the player's done, the dealer keeps hitting until his cards reach a total value of 17 or more</p>

<h2>Scoring:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Player wins if their hand has a greater total point value than the dealer's, without going over 21.</li>
<li>A winning blackjack pays 3:2</li>
<li>If both the player and the dealer have a tie — including with a blackjack — the bet is a tie or "push" and money is neither lost, nor paid.</li>
<li>All other winning hands pay even money, 1:1.</li>
<li>If either the player or the dealer exceed 21 or "bust" the hand automatically loses.</li>
<li>If both the dealer and player bust, the player loses.</li>
<li>Insurance pays 2:1</li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd card it is considered a "blackjack" and the player is paid out immediately.
The hand ties if dealer also has a natural.</p>
